Bad Block Game
==============

This is just a random bad block game, play if you want.
PS: Worked on while I have nothing to do.

# Build

To compile, you have to have [cmake](https://cmake.org/) installed, then open your favorite shell and change directory to the repository.
In the repository directory run this:

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
```

Depending on your platform, you can do the following:

Windows
-------

Open the .sln file in the build directory and build and run the project from Microsoft Visual Studio.


Linux and Mac
-------------

Compilation on linux and mac os requires gcc, g++ and make to be installed.
After you have confirmed that you have it installed, run this in the build directory:

```bash
make
```
